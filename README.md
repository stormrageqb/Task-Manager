## 📄 Description

This is a classic task manager application with some extra functionality perks. I've included a dark/light theme toggle and the ability to drag and drop tasks to reorder their priority. I also added a bit of animation to provide more interactivity throughout the application and a modal to confirm all deletions.
<br/>

## ⚙ Functionality

Users can...

- Add new tasks to their todo list and view them upon refreshing the page
- Edit existing tasks on the fly
- Delete existing tasks
- Mark existing tasks as complete
- Delete all tasks marked as completed
- Drag and drop tasks to reorder them
- Filter tasks by all, active, and completed tasks
- Toggle between dark and light theme
- View the application on desktop and mobile devices
- See how many todos remain to be completed
- See how many characters remain for their typed task

## 💻 Concepts

I built this project to practice React core concepts, but also to get more comfortable with state management and the useReducer hook, custom hooks, styled components, and drag and drop technology.
